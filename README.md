# VM Verify: Automated Proxmox VM testing

Ever had a VM restore but fail to boot or critical services fail to start? We all know that we should test our backups but it can be tough to do manually. Inspired by the backup verification technology behind [Datto BCDR](https://www.datto.com/products/siris/features/) SIRIS devices and combined with the file-level verification already done by Proxmox Backup Server, VM Verify covers the gap and makes sure that you're taking good and functional backups.

### More to come

* POC
* Logging
    * Log file
    * Syslog
    * Webhook
* Ability to use custom verification scripts


*At this time, this is a work in progress.*
